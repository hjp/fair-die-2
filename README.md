Just a little C#/WPF test program.

I bought a 30-sided die and wondered whether it was fair. Normally I'd write a little simulation in Perl, but I was curious how much work that would be in C# (with a little bit of GUI around it).

Oh, and this repo is called fair-die-2 because Github support in Visual Studio is confusing.
